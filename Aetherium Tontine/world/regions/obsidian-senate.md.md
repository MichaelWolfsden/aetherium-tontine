# The Obsidian Senate (Greco-Roman)

## Geography
- **Capital:** New Byzantium (Part-Ground, Part-Sky Paradox)
- **Climate:** Mediterranean decay, marble stained with soot
- **Dominant Terrain:** Crumbling classical architecture retrofitted with steam-pipes
- **Flux Level:** 2D (dying magic preserved in crypts)

## Fracture History
- **Year 0:** Archimedes distills first Aetherium rod (The Sunderer's Gambit)
- **Year 45:** Optimates vs. Populares civil war—Optimates win, Populares to Philosopher's Crypt
- **Year 67:** Crypt founded as Covenant bank and shadow government
- **Current Crisis:** Senate pretends Crypt doesn't exist; Crypt prepares for post-Senate world

## Political Landscape
- **Faction Split:** Senate (Consortium puppets) vs. Philosopher's Crypt (Covenant leadership)
- **Resource Control:** 40% of "legitimate" Aetherium trade, 80% of black-market mythic artifacts
- **Subversive Elements:** Unchained Protocol data-crypt raids, smugglers in harbor district

## Cultural Notes
- **Decadent Nostalgia:** Togas over exoskeletons, aetheric opera that shatters glass
- **Art:** Imitation of dead magic
- **Technology:** Outsource everything to Compact; focus on appearance over function

## Current Threats
- **Crypt Exposed:** Rumors of Senate-Covenant link reaching Consortium ears
- **Reality Bleed:** Old magic artifacts activating spontaneously as Flux fluctuates
