## Political Landscape
- **Faction Philosophy:** Onmyōji treat Aetherium as "temporary guest"
- **Resource Control:** 100% of wind-spirit tech, 80% of long-term sustainability research
- **Subversive Elements:** None—harmony approach makes them resistant to subversion

## Cultural Notes
- **Philosophical Pragmatism:** Balance above progress
- **Technology:** Karakuri automatons powered by captured wind-spirits
