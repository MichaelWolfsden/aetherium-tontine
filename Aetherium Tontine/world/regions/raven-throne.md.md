# The Raven Throne (Scandinavian)

## Geography
- **Capital:** Nidhogg's Harbor (Grounded Longship-City)
- **Climate:** Cold, salted winds, geothermal heat from hybrid engines
- **Dominant Terrain:** Coastal fjords, floating longship districts, wyld-marshes
- **Flux Level:** 3D (last hybrid power zone)

## Fracture History
- **Year -3:** Völva prophesies the Fracture (prophecy magic now extinct)
- **Year 90-150:** Wylding Wars—guerrilla raids using hybrid sails/engines
- **Year 300:** Treaty of Half-Measures signed—50% Aetherium, 50% magic
- **Current Crisis:** Last Völva died in Year 499; no more prophecies

## Political Landscape
- **Faction Balance:** Covenant (traditionalists) vs. Unchained Protocol (pragmatists)
- **Resource Control:** 100% of hybrid engine patents, 40% of sea-sky salvage
- **Subversive Elements:** None—internal politics are the main threat

## Cultural Notes
- **Honor-Bound:** Skalds can make engines weep, Berserkers have hydraulic rage-pumps
- **Hero-Worship:** Erik Gear-Heart, last true Viking, died Year 411
- **Technology:** Inefficient, beautiful, doomed

## Current Threats
- **Magic Fade:** Sorcerers aging, last generation of wyld-mages dying
- **Ragnarök Clock:** Without prophecy, they can't see the end coming
