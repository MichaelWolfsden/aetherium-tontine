# The Dusk Sultanate (East-Indian)

## Geography
- **Capital:** Jadepool (City of Floating Gardens)
- **Climate:** Tropical, humidity-controlled by botanical engines
- **Dominant Terrain:** Resonance gardens, spice-mech bazaars, hidden wells
- **Flux Level:** 4D (artificially sustained)

## Fracture History
- **Year 87:** Pact of Seven Gardens—sacrifice magical potency for survival
- **Year 100:** Resonance Engine unveiled—burns Aetherium at 1/10th cost
- **Year 200-300:** Become world's pharmacists, selling "clean Aetherium"
- **Current Crisis:** Consortium demanding Resonance Engine schematics; Jade Mandate pressuring alliance

## Political Landscape
- **Faction Autonomy:** Refuses full Consortium integration
- **Resource Control:** 90% of Dream-Dust production, 100% of Resonance Engine tech
- **Subversive Elements:** None—internal security is absolute

## Cultural Notes
- **Mystical Mercantilism:** Chakra-Engineers weave Aetherium into silk
- **Technology:** Biological integration—gardens as infrastructure
- **Motto:** *"We sell tomorrow to those who can afford today"*

## Current Threats
- **Consortium Siege:** Trade embargo tightening
- **Mandate Courtship:** Risk of becoming puppet state
