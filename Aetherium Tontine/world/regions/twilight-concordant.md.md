# The Twilight Concordant (Franco-Iberian)

## Geography
- **Capital:** Ciel d'Sang (City of Perpetual Half-Light)
- **Climate:** Broken solar engine—permanent twilight, temperature-controlled by steam-vents
- **Dominant Terrain:** Barricaded boroughs, blood-drenched plazas, revolutionary murals
- **Flux Level:** 2D (unstable, contested)

## Fracture History
- **Year 210:** Revolución de los Gremios crushed by Consortium
- **Year 387:** Cult of the Dying Sun excommunicated by Covenant for magitech heresy
- **Year 402:** Solar engine sabotaged—never repaired
- **Current Crisis:** Borough-level civil war between Consortium, Covenant, and independent syndicates

## Political Landscape
- **Faction Warzone:** No single dominion—Consortium holds financial district, Covenant holds catacombs, syndicates control trade
- **Resource Control:** 30% of artifice-smuggling, 50% of Dream-Dust production
- **Subversive Elements:** Every faction active; neutrality is death

## Cultural Notes
- **Passionate Fatalism:** Aetheric Tango illegal in 7 empires, vapor-derringer signature weapon
- **Technology:** Improvised, experimental, beautiful and unreliable
- **Motto:** *"We die in the light we create"*

## Current Threats
- **Borough Collapse:** Starboard Quarter falling into blight-sinkhole
- **Syndicate War:** Three merchant-princes fighting for Dream-Dust monopoly
