# The Alchemically Unleashed

## Cultural Adaptation
Exposure to Phlogiston waste causes spontaneous alchemical transmutation—bodies become living hybrids of magic and technology. They are the Tontine's accidental children, born from its toxic waste. Each is unique, a walking testament to the world's broken metabolism. They are shunned, studied, and occasionally worshipped as "the next evolution."

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** Roll d6 at character creation for mutation
  1-2: **Aetheric Breath** (-1D): Can exhale small amounts of fuel (1 charge/day)
  3-4: **Clockwork Heart** (-1D): Immune to poison, metal detectors detect you
  5-6: **Unstable Morphology** (-1D): Wild Die on Physical rolls always explodes, but 1s cause 1 wound
- **Advantages:**
  - **Hybrid Biology** (-2D): +1D to resist both magic and technology-based effects
  - **Waste-Born** (-1D): Phlogiston exposure heals 1 Body Point (but causes temporary mutation)
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Uncontrolled Mutation** (+3D): Each session, roll d6: 1-2 = new temporary physical flaw
  - **Hunted** (+2D): Consortium wants to study you; Covenant fears you're "unnatural"
  - **Social Pariah** (+1D): -2D to Social with pure organics or pure constructs
- **Starting Templates:** Mutant-Brute, Waste-Witch, Unstable-Savant

## Current Status
- **Population:** <1% of global (rare, scattered)
- **Flux Resilience:** Variable (depends on mutation)
- **Social Standing:** Freak (most) → Prophet (some cults)

## Manifestations
- **Breath-Touched:** Glow faintly, emit steam-wisps (+1D Intimidate)
- **Heart-Bound:** Ticking audible, vulnerability to magnets (+1D Technical)
- **Morph-Flux:** Appearance shifts slightly each day (+1D Disguise)

## Notable Individuals
