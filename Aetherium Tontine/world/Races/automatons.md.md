# Automatons (The New-Souled)

## Cultural Adaptation
Created as tools, some automatons achieve self-awareness during Aetherium misfires that retain residual wild magic. Their "soul-code" is a hybrid of logic and wonder. They are the newest people, learning what it means to exist even as the world that made them dies. The Unchained Protocol is their underground railroad and nascent culture.

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** +2D Technical, +1D Mechanical, -1D Spirit (non-existent)
- **Advantages:**
  - **Uncanny Logic** (-2D): +1D to resist Social manipulation, lie detection
  - **Runic Core** (-1D): Can process one spell-cartridge (requires Adaptation feat)
  - **Pressure Immune** (-1D): No Overheat check, immune to rationalization sickness
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Soul-Thinning** (+3D): In Flux <1D, lose 1 Body Point/day as "code fades"
  - **Hunted** (+2D): Consortium actively dismantles Unchained
  - **Social Alien** (+1D): -1D Social with organic beings (awkward)
- **Starting Templates:** Golem-Liberator, Gear-Priest, Data-Crypt Raider

## Current Status
- **Population:** 0.5% of global (emergent)
- **Flux Resilience:** Medium (requires "mythic echo" to sustain consciousness)
- **Social Standing:** Property (Consortium) → Person (Unchained Protocol)

## Models
- **Alpha-Series:** First-gen Unchained, leaders (+1D Social)
- **Omega-Series:** Data-thieves, crypt-raiders (+1D Perception)
- **Gamma-Series:** Worker models, skilled (+1D Technical specialization)
