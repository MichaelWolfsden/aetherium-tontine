# Goblins (The Junker Tribes)

## Cultural Adaptation
They don't build. They *unbuild*. Goblins live in the Ferromancer's Spine's maintenance ducts, in blight-zones where magic is a bad memory, in the walls of Vostok-Prime. They're immune to rationalization sickness—maybe because they're already rational to the bone. They see a machine and they see lunch. Their oral tradition is the **Scrap-Saga**, tales told in the rhythm of a failing engine.

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** +1D Perception, +1D Technical, -1D Strength (small), -1D Social (outcast)
- **Advantages:**
  - **Jury-Rig Master** (-1D): Get any broken device working for 1d6 rounds with Moderate Technical roll
  - **Unseen** (-1D): Nobles literally can't see goblins unless goblins want them to (+3D Stealth vs. Noble Birth)
  - **Scrap-Sight** (-1D): +2D to find salvageable parts in any environment
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Social Outcast** (+2D): -2D to Social with non-goblins
  - **Addicted to Scrap** (+1D): Must spend 1 hour/day tinkering or -1D all Technical rolls
  - **Small Stature** (+1D): -1D to Strength-based resistance rolls
- **Starting Templates:** Junker-Scout, Gear-Rat, Piston-Shaman

## Current Status
- **Population:** Unknown (uncounted, unwanted)
- **Flux Resilience:** High (immune to rationalization)
- **Social Standing:** Vermin (Consortium) → Useful (Unchained Protocol)

## Tribes
- **Piston-Clan:** Heavy machinery focus, +1D Repair
- **Gasket-Brood:** Seal-making, leak-plugging (+1D to stop environmental hazards)
- **Duct-Rats:** Navigation experts, know Spine like veins (+1D Stealth underground)
