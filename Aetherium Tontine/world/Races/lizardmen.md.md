# Lizardmen (The Vital Mires)

## Cultural Adaptation
They were here before the Fracture. They'll be here after. The swamps that birthed them are now "vital mires"—the last places where life-magic, not ley-line magic, still works. They draw power from biomass, from rot and growth, from the cycle. The Consortium can't meter that. Yet. Their **Shamans** are called **Life-Weavers**, and they believe the Fracture is a fever the world must sweat out.

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** +1D Stamina, +1D Knowledge (Natural Philosophy), -1D Technical (anti-tech)
- **Advantages:**
  - **Blight-Touched** (-1D): Immune to environmental rationalization sickness
  - **Life-Weave** (-2D): Can draw 1D magic from biomass in vital mires (Difficult 20)
  - **Cold-Blooded** (-1D): External heat required, but immune to poison/disease
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Aetherium Vulnerability** (+3D): Direct Aetherium exposure causes 2D damage
  - **Heat-Dependent** (+1D): In cold zones (<50°F), -1D to all physical rolls
  - **Technophobe** (+1D): -1D to operate any Aetherium device
- **Starting Templates:** Swamp-Guardian, Life-Weaver, Steam-Crocodile Rider

## Current Status
- **Population:** 2% of global (stable but isolated)
- **Flux Resilience:** Very High (use biomass, not ley lines)
- **Social Standing:** Ignored (Consortium) → Allied (Covenant)

## Broods
- **Mire-Brood:** Traditionalists, swamp defense (+1D Survival)
- **Ash-Brood:** Adapted to blight zones, filter-feed on Phlogiston (+1D Resistance)
- **Steam-Brood:** Crocodile-riders, have learned to tolerate Aetherium steam (+1D Ride)
