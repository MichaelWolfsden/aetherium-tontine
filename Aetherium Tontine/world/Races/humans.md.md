# Humans (The Flux-Touched)

## Cultural Adaptation
Most humans developed "Aetherium tolerance"—a genetic quirk allowing them to process distilled magic without immediate mutation. The Admiralty's Levitation-rated nobles represent the elite of this adaptation, while "Ballast" workers choke on soot and shortened lifespans. Humans are the architects of the Tontine, the ones who turned wonder into ledger entries.

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** None (baseline)
- **Advantages:** 
  - **Aetherium Resonance** (-2D): +1D to Technical in Flux 2D+ zones
- **Disadvantages:** 
  - **Mythic Dependency** (+3D): Cannot survive in 0D Flux zones (lose 1 Body Point/day)
- **Starting Templates:** Aetheric Aeronaut, Consortium Inquisitor, Clockwork Savant

## Current Status
- **Population:** 60% of global (dominant)
- **Flux Resilience:** Low (dependent on Aetherium infrastructure)
- **Social Standing:** Stratified (Levitation-rated nobles vs. Ballast workers)

## Sub-Ethnicities
- **Anglo-Saxon (Admiralty):** Maritime-industrial hybrid, +1D Piloting
- **Greco-Roman (Senate):** Decadent nostalgia, +1D Social
- **Franco-Iberian (Concordant):** Passionate improvisation, +1D to first Wild Die each session
