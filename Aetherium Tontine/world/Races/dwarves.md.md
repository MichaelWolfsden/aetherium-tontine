# Dwarves (The Iron-Blooded)

## Cultural Adaptation
When the Fracture reached their mountain holds, the dwarves made a collective choice: replace flesh with steam. Entire clans underwent "Industrial Augmentation," becoming 60% mechanical. Their ancient rune-craft is fading as magic dies, so they use Technical skill to simulate old enchantments. They are walking scrap-heaps, ticking and grinding toward obsolescence.

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** +1D Strength, -1D Reflexes (heavy)
- **Advantages:**
  - **Steam-Piston Limbs** (-3D): Strength 5D for lifting/crushing
  - **Rune-Simulation** (-1D): Can use Technical skill to mimic magic effects (Difficulty +5)
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Weekly Maintenance** (+2D): Must recharge Aetherium core or become Stunned
  - **Soul-Thinning** (+3D): In Flux <2D, lose 1 Body Point/day from existential decay
- **Starting Templates:** Ironwright, Steam-Priest, Augmented Berserker

## Current Status
- **Population:** Declining (5% of global)
- **Flux Resilience:** Very Low (dependent on technology)
- **Social Standing:** Respected engineers, feared as "unnatural"

## Sub-Clans
- **Piston-Clan:** Heavy industry focus, +1D Technical (Repair)
- **Gear-Clan:** Fine clockwork, +1D Coordination (small tools)
- **Forge-Clan:** Military augmentation, +1D Strength (combat)
