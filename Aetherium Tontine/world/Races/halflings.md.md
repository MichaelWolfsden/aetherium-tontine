# Halflings (The Garden Society)

## Cultural Adaptation
They were the first miniaturizers, the ones who made Aetherium portable. Their shires were the first to be blighted—turned into monoculture farms for "maximum efficiency." Now they wander in caravans, tending hidden gardens in the shadows of cities. They preserve seeds, songs, and sanity. Their greatest treasure is a **Real Seed** from before the Fracture, said to grow into a tree that produces pure mana fruit.

## D6 Mechanics
- **Attribute Mods:** +1D Coordination, +1D Perception, -1D Strength (small)

  - **Green Thumb** (-2D): Can create Mythic Resonance +0.5D by tending gardens in blight zones
  - **Resistant** (-1D): +1D to resist rationalization sickness

  - **Homesick** (+2D): -1D to all rolls when >10 miles from last "garden sanctuary"

## Current Status
- **Population:** Diaspora (4% of global, scattered)
