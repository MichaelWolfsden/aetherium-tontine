# Orcs (The Piston-Clans)

## Cultural Adaptation
The orcs volunteered for "Industrial Augmentation"—hydraulic piston grafts, boiler-lung implants, adrenal surge-pumps. They are the Iron Compact's shock troops, the hammer that breaks strikes and conquers frontiers. What began as a choice has become a cultural identity: to be strong is to be mechanical. To be mechanical is to be free of flesh's weakness. Or so they tell themselves as they overheat in battle.
