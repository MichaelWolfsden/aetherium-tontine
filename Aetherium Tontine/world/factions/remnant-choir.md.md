- **Goal:** Reverse the Fracture, even if it requires collapsing civilization
- **Method:** Reality storms, possession, awakening feral zones
- **Belief:** Magic is life; Aetherium is cancer; humanity is the tumor

## Resources
- **Aetherium Reserves:** None (cannot use, would destroy them)
- **Territorial Control:** Verdant Scar (contested), feral zones, reality fractures
- **Manpower:** Nature spirits, fading gods, creatures dependent on high Flux

## Goals
- Destroy Vostok-Prime (largest depletion engine)
- Corrupt Ferromancer's Spine with reality storms
- Possess key Consortium officials to sow chaos
- Awaken all slumbering ley-wards simultaneously

## Relationships
