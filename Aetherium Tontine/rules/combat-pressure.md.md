# The Pressure Gauge (Optional Combat Tension)

## Concept
When tension rises, so does danger. Pressure represents mounting chaos, steam buildup, reality fraying.

## Pressure Pool
- **Starts at:** 0D
- **Max:** 5D
- **GM only:** Track secretly or openly

## Gaining Pressure
+1D when:
- Wild Die 1 rolled in combat
- Hyperflux device activated
- Reputation hits -3D with faction
- Outnumbered 3:1
- In Blight Zone with active magic

## Spending Pressure (GM)
Spend 1D to:
- **Increase enemy dice:** +1D to opponent's next roll
- **Trigger hazard:** Steam vent, pipe rupture, reality quake (2D damage, Difficult 20 to avoid)
- **Cause malfunction:** Player's Aetherium device fails (Wild Die 1 effect)
- **Summon reinforcements:** 1D6 mooks arrive in 1d3 rounds
- **Reality Bleed:** Narrate surreal complication (player's magic warps)

## Venting Pressure (Players)
Spend **1 Fate Point** to reduce Pressure by 1D.
**Must narrate how:** Song, speech, sacrifice, tactical retreat.

## Pressure Cascade
If Pressure reaches 5D:
- **Catastrophic Event:** Engine breach, reality storm, betrayal
- **All dice:** +5 Difficulty for 1d6 rounds
- **Afterward:** Pressure resets to 0D, region Flux -0.5D

## Example
**Round 1:** Jaguar Knight rolls Wild Die 1 → Pressure 1D  
**Round 2:** Hyperflux derringer fired → Pressure 2D  
**Round 3:** GM spends 1D → Enemy Inquisitor gets +1D to arrest roll  
**Round 4:** Skald-Berserker vents: "Hear my saga!" → Spends Fate Point, Pressure 1D

## Integration with Flux
In Flux <2D, Pressure gains are doubled (world actively fighting magic).
In Flux 6D+, Pressure can be vented without Fate Point (world cooperates).

## Optional: Public Pressure
Reveal Pressure pool to players. Turns combat into resource management.
**Warning:** May encourage meta-gaming; use only with experienced groups.
