# Echoes & Anomalies: When Reality Remembers

## Mythic Echoes
Semi-permanent story elements created by **Wild Die 6 on Repletion roll** or **Flux 8D+ zone interactions**.

### Echo Creation
**Trigger:** Wild Die 6 on Repletion roll (Difficulty 30+)  
**Process:**
1. Player narrates desired Echo (subject to GM veto)
2. Echo must be **non-mechanical** (no combat advantage)
3. Must tie to Repletion action (garden, song, spirit, artifact)

**Examples:**
- **Garden:** Grows 1 sq mile/session if tended, produces nostalgic fruit
- **Song:** Haunts area, workers hum it, +1D morale to allies
- **Spirit:** Friendly ghost offers cryptic advice, memories of pre-Fracture
- **Artifact:** Mundane object becomes minor magic (compass points to hope)

### Echo Mechanics
- **Duration:** Permanent until destroyed or abandoned
- **Nurture:** Must be tended weekly (Repletion roll vs. 15) or it fades
- **Flux Cost:** 0 (Echo is self-sustaining)
- **Reputation:** +0.5D with Covenant per Echo maintained

### Echo Risks
**50% chance per session:** Echo attracts **Remnant Choir** attention  
**Roll d6:**
1-3: Choir admires Echo, offers blessing (temporary +1D magic)
4-5: Choir is confused, inspects (reality quakes for 1 round)
6: Choir is offended, attacks Echo (requires defense)

## Reality Anomalies
Random occurrences in **Flux 6D+** zones.

### Anomaly Triggers
- **Wild Die 6 + Wild Die 6 in same roll:** Minor anomaly
- **Three actions with Wild Die 6 in one session:** Major anomaly
- **Natural 6,6,6 on three dice:** Cascade anomaly

### Minor Anomalies (d6)
1. **Memory Fog:** Everyone remembers event differently (no mechanical effect)
2. **Gravity Blip:** One round of weightlessness (Coordination vs. 10 or fall)
3. **Color Shift:** Everything tinted blue-green for 1d6 hours (aesthetic)
4. **Echo Whispers:** Hear snippets of past conversations (plot hooks)
5. **Time Hiccup:** Relive last 10 seconds (favortism, replay one action)
6. **Spirit Mote:** Glowing orb follows party, curious (harmless)

### Major Anomalies (d6)
1. **Reality Bleed:** Personal memory becomes tangible (NPC appears)
2. **Flux Surge:** All magic +1D for 1d6 rounds, then -1D for 1d6 rounds
3. **Age Shift:** Everyone ages 1d10 years temporarily (1 session)
4. **Aetherium Rain:** Phlogiston crystals fall from sky (salvageable but dangerous)
5. **Machine Empathy:** Automatons in region become Unchained for 1 day
6. **Ley Line Ghost:** Manifestation of dead ley line—offers bargain

### Cascade Anomaly (d6)
1. **Temporal Loop:** Relive last hour (Groundhog Day scenario)
2. **Dimensional Merge:** Another dimension overlaps (fight shadow-selves)
3. **Mythic Rebirth:** All wounds heal, all curses lift (Repletion +2D)
4. **Reality Collapse:** Region becomes Dead Zone for 1d6 sessions
5. **Tontine Call:** Every NPC demands party pay "their share" (social crisis)
6. **The Fracture Repeats:** Magic becomes wild for 1d6 sessions (no spells, only chaos)

## GM Protocol for Anomalies

**When to Use:**
- **Major Plot Point:** Anomaly reveals secret (memory fog shows hidden door)
- **Tone Shift:** Comedy break (gravity blip) after heavy session
- **Foreshadowing:** Anomaly hints at future catastrophe (Aetherium rain before Cascade Failure)

**When NOT to Use:**
- **Every session:** Anomalies lose wonder if common
- **During combat:** Unless it affects everyone equally
- **If it breaks campaign:** No time loops unless you're prepared to run them

## Player-Triggered Anomalies

Players can **intentionally cause anomalies**:

- **Sacrifice Fate Point:** +2D to causing anomaly (Performance vs. 30)
    
- **Risk:** 50% chance anomaly backlashes (targets player)
    
- **Reward:** If successful, creates Mythic Echo without Repletion roll
    

## Echo vs. Anomaly

| Feature        | Echo                  | Anomaly              |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Cause**      | Repletion Wild 6      | High Flux random     |
| **Duration**   | Permanent (if tended) | 1d6 rounds/sessions  |
| **Control**    | Player/GT chooses     | GM rolls randomly    |
| **Effect**     | Story benefit         | Chaos (good and bad) |
| **Reputation** | +Covenant             | Variable             |
**Both attract Remnant Choir.** Keep them rare. Make them matter.
