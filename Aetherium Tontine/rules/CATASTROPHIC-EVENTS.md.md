# Catastrophic Events: When the World Breaks

## Doom Track
Each region has a **Doom Track** (0/6). Fill one box when:
- **Hyperflux detonation** in region
- **Flux reaches 0D** for first time
- **Reality storm** triggered (Wild Die 1, 1, 1 in sequence)
- **Faction war** erupts (Consortium vs. Covenant full conflict)
- **PC action** causes cascade failure (e.g., sabotage Engine #8)

## Event Categories

### Type 1: Hyperflux Detonation
**Trigger:** Hyperflux rod explodes (malfunction or sabotage)  
**Immediate:** -3D regional Flux  
**Aftershock:** Region becomes Blight Zone for 10 sessions  
**Cascade:** Adjacent regions -1D Flux each  
**Narrative:** "The sky screams. The ground forgets its name. For a moment, silence is deafening."

**Example:** Engine #8 critical failure  
- **Doom Track:** +2 boxes (4/6 → 6/6)
- **Result:** Vostok-Prime begins 72-hour crash sequence

### Type 2: Great Unbinding (Repeat)
**Trigger:** Covenant performs mass ley-line severing ritual  
**Immediate:** +5D Flux in ritual zone (chaotic), -2D Flux in adjacent regions  
**Aftershock:** New Verdant Scar created (200-mile reality storm)  
**Cascade:** All Aetherium devices in 100-mile radius malfunction for 1d6 days  
**Narrative:** "The world tears like paper. Magic doesn't leave—it *screams*."

**Example:** Second Great Unbinding in Iron Compact territory  
- **Doom Track:** +3 boxes for Compact region
- **Result:** Königsforge becomes contested zone, Gear-Priests openly revolt

### Type 3: Reality Cascade
**Trigger:** Three Wild Die 1s rolled in sequence by same player/region  
**Immediate:** Local reality fractures for 1d6 rounds  
**Effects:** (Roll d6 each round)
1. Gravity reverses (up is down)
2. Time loops (repeat last action)
3. Magic becomes wild magic (random targets)
4. Technology becomes sentient (hostile)
5. PC and NPC swap bodies
6. Everyone sees different dimension

**Aftershock:** Region Flux -0.5D permanently  
**Narrative:** "The dice betray you. The world laughs."

### Type 4: Tontine Default
**Trigger:** Regional Flux 0D for 3 consecutive sessions  
**Immediate:** Tontine "calls in the debt"—reality begins foreclosure  
**Effects:**
- All Aetherium devices become inert slag
- Automatons achieve mass sentience (Unchained Protocol event)
- Living beings age 1 year per day until Flux rises
- Remnant Choir manifests physically, demands sacrifice

**Narrative:** "The world holds out its hand. Payment is due."

### Type 5: Cascade Failure
**Trigger:** Doom Track reaches 6/6  
**Immediate:** Regional catastrophe
- **Vostok-Prime:** City crashes, releases 10,000 Hyperflux rods
- **Königsforge:** Factory singularity, all Aetherium in 100 miles rushes to one point
- **Verdant Scar:** Reality storm expands 2x, becomes permanent
- **Tenochtitlan:** Blood-mana pipeline ruptures, half population mutates

**Aftershock:** Global Flux -1D  
**Narrative:** "The engine of the world seizes. Silence. Then screaming."

## Catastrophic Event Protocol (GM)

**Step 1: Announce Omen**
1 session before event:
- "Strange harmonics in Engine #8. Workers report hearing voices."
- "The Spine's schedule is off by 0.3 seconds. Engineers are panicking."
- "Remnant Choir sightings increase 500%."

**Step 2: Offer Prevention**
- **Quest:** Difficult (25) to stop event (sabotage ritual, repair engine, negotiate peace)
- **Cost:** Must sacrifice something (Aetherium, Reputation, character safety)
- **Timeline:** 1 session to act

**Step 3: If Prevention Fails**
- Trigger event at start of next session
- Apply immediate mechanical effects
- Narrate consequences in noir-steampunk cadence
- Update Mythic Ledger with world-state changes

**Step 4: Cascading Consequences**
Track **Tertiary Effects**:
- **Session +1:** Refugees, resource shortages
- **Session +2:** Faction realignment, new NPCs emerge
- **Session +3:** Permanent world changes (new regions, lost regions)

## Player Agency in Catastrophes
Players can **trigger** catastrophes intentionally:
- **Sabotage Engine #8:** Doom Track +2, but cripples Consortium
- **Second Unbinding:** Creates new Scar, but saves ley line
- **Detonate Hyperflux:** Kills region, but damages Consortium globally

**Moral Choice:** Is burning the village to save the world acceptable?

## Recovery from Catastrophe
**Mythic Repletion Ritual (Difficulty 40):**
- Requires: 10 willing sacrifices, 100 Aetherium rods (burned as offering), 1 session of pure Repletion actions
- **Result:** Reset Doom Track to 0, region Flux +2D
- **Cost:** Global reputation—some will call you terrorists

## Campaign Endgame Cascade
If **3 regions** reach Doom Track 6/6:
- **Event:** Final Fracture—world splits into magic and machine dimensions
- **Result:** Campaign ends, players choose which dimension to inhabit
