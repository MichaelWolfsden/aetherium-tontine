# Player Indicators: Sensing the Flux

## Design Principle
Players never see the Flux number. They **feel** it through sensory descriptions.

## Vital Zone (Flux 8D-10D)
**GM Description Language:**
- "The air hums with potential, like before a storm. Colors are saturated—too bright, almost painful."
- "You swear the walls are breathing. Shadows move when you're not looking."
- "Your magic comes easily, almost eagerly, like a dog greeting its master."
- "Sparks dance in your periphery. The world is *watching* you."

**Player Mechanics:**
- Magic: +2D to all spell rolls
- Wild Die: Explodes on 5 or 6
- Environmental: Spirits manifest physically (can be conversed with)
- Social: NPCs are charmed, awed, or terrified of your presence

**Internal Sensation:** "Your veins buzz. You feel bigger than your body."

## Wyld Zone (Flux 5D-7D)
**GM Description Language:**
- "Magic feels natural here, like a remembered song you can almost hum."
- "The world is responsive. Your intentions feel... heard."
- "Aetherium devices purr instead of clank—when they work, they *like* working."

**Player Mechanics:**
- Standard D6 Fantasy rules apply
- Wild Die: Normal (6 explodes, 1 complicates)
- Environmental: Minor magical phenomena (glowing moss, singing stones)

**Internal Sensation:** "Your soul fits in your skin comfortably."

## Thin Zone (Flux 2D-4D)
**GM Description Language:**
- "Magic is a whisper, hard to grasp. Your intentions feel... muffled."
- "Aetherium burns with a whine instead of a roar. It's *straining*."
- "The world feels 'thin,' like paper. You can almost see through it."
- "Colors are washed out. Sounds are flat."

**Player Mechanics:**
- Magic: Difficult (+5 to TN)
- Wild Die: 1 causes **Reality Bleed** (GM narrates surreal consequence)
- Environmental: Minor glitches (footsteps echo wrong, shadows lag)

**Internal Sensation:** "You feel hollow. Your magic fizzles like a wet match."

## Blight Zone (Flux 1D)
**GM Description Language:**
- "Magic is a memory. You remember remembering it, but can't quite touch it."
- "Aetherium coughs and sputters. Sometimes it laughs at you."
- "The air tastes like iron and regret. The sky is the wrong color."
- "Your soul feels... rationed."

**Player Mechanics:**
- Magic: +10 Difficulty
- Wild Die: 1 causes **Reality Bleed** (2D stun damage)
- Repletion: Rolls at -1D penalty (world is resistant)
- Environmental: Static on aetheric radio, ghost images

**Internal Sensation:** "You feel like you're being erased one pencil stroke at a time."

## Dead Zone (Flux 0D)
**GM Description Language:**
- "Silence. Pure silence. Even your thoughts feel mechanical."
- "Aetherium rods are just metal. They don't even get warm."
- "The silence is deafening. Your soul feels lighter—too light."
- "Automatons look at you with something like pity. They have purpose. You have... absence."

**Player Mechanics:**
- **NO MAGIC.** Spell attempts automatically fail.
- Wild Die: **Disabled** (treat as normal die)
- Body Points: Lose 1 per day from "soul-thinning" (no resistance)
- Automatons: +1D Technical (world is logical now)
- Environmental: Perfect geometry, no randomness, clocks are *too* accurate

**Internal Sensation:** "You feel like a ghost haunting your own body."

## Communicating Flux Changes
Don't say: "Flux drops from 3D to 2D."  
Say: "The humming in your bones quiets. The sparks stop dancing. You feel... alone."

## Player Questions
If players ask "What does it feel like here?":  
**Roll Spirit vs. 15:**  
- **Success:** You can *sense* the Flux level (give them band: High/Medium/Low/Dead)  
- **Wild Die 6:** You can sense the *exact* number (but they won't know what the number means)  
- **Wild Die 1:** You sense the opposite (GM lies)

## Flux Sickness
In zones with Flux difference >3D from your "home" zone:  
- **Symptoms:** Headaches, nausea, magical backlash  
- **Mechanics:** -1D to all rolls for 1d6 hours  
- **Immunity:** Spend 1 Character Point to adapt (permanent for that region type)
