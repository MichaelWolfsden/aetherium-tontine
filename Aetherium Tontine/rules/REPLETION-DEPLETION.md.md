# Repletion & Depletion: The Thermomythic Cycle

## The Two Laws

### First Law: Depletion (Entropy)
*Every Aetherium burn permanently reduces Mythic Flux.*

**Formula:** `Depletion = Charges × Rod Multiplier ÷ Regional Radius (miles)`

| Rod Type | Multiplier | 10 Charges, 1-Mile Radius | 10 Charges, City (0.5-mile radius) |
|----------|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Standard | 0.1D | -1.0D | -2.0D (double) |
| Hyperflux | 1.0D | -10.0D (catastrophic) | -20.0D (extinction) |
| Blood-Mana | 0.2D | -2.0D | -4.0D |
| Phlogiston | -0.1D* | +1.0D (chaotic) | +2.0D (volatile) |

*Phlogiston is waste—burning releases trapped mythic energy chaotically

### Second Law: Repletion (Memory)
*The world can remember wonder through sacrifice.*

**Formula:** `Repletion = Narrative Weight × Difficulty Modifier`

| Action | Difficulty | Base Flux Δ | Max/Session | Example |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Minor Beauty | 25 | +0.5D | +1.0D | Plant garden in slum |
| Teach Myth | 15 | +0.1D | +0.3D | Story to child |
| Sacrifice Item | 30 | +1.0D | +1.0D | Magic sword → forest |
| Heroic Death | 50 | +3.0D | +3.0D | Suicide ritual |

## Depletion Protocol (Per Session)

**Step 1: Tally Charges**
- **Individual:** Each player notes rods used
- **Faction:** NPC groups use estimated consumption
- **Environmental:** Cities burn 1 rod/100 people/day

**Step 2: Calculate Loss**

Example: Session in Vostok-Prime

- Party used: 5 standard rods = 5 charges
    
- City used: 10,000 rods = 10,000 charges
    
- Total: 10,005 charges × 0.1D (city radius 0.5 miles, double) = -2001D
    

**Cap:** Maximum -1D/session for gameplay purposes **Note:** "City depletion is abstracted—10,000 rods = -1D regional"


**Step 3: Apply to Regional Ledger**

# In world/regions/vostok-prime.md
- **Flux Level:** 2D → 1D (Session_003)
- **Depletion Source:** Party 5 charges, City 10,000 charges
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-13T14:30:00Z

**Step 4: Narrate Consequence** GM tells party: "Engine #8's whine rises an octave. Workers look paler. The Song in the pipes is quieter."

## Repletion Protocol (Per Session)

**Step 1: Qualify the Action** Must meet **2+ criteria**:

- [ ] No mechanical benefit to actor
    
- [ ] Advances another PC's arc
    
- [ ] Creates beauty in blight zone
    
- [ ] Risks safety for world-building
    
- [ ] Refuses optimal choice for moral reason
    

**Step 2: Set Difficulty**

- **Base:** 25 (Moderate-Heroic range)
    
- **Modifiers:** -5 if in Vital Zone, +5 if in Dead Zone
    

**Step 3: Narrative Weight Bonus**

- **Personal sacrifice:** -5 Difficulty (lose item, take wound)
    
- **Public performance:** -3 Difficulty (10+ witnesses)
    
- **Symbolic resonance:** -2 Difficulty (mythic anniversary, sacred site)
    

**Step 4: Roll & Resolve**

- **Roll:** Spirit/Knowledge/Performance vs. Difficulty
    
- **NO Character Points** allowed (must be pure)
    
- **Wild Die 6:** Breakthrough! +1D Flux, +1D Resonance
    
- **Wild Die 1:** Rejection! -2D Flux, Ritual fails
    

**Step 5: Apply & Narrate**

Example: Skald-Berserker sacrifices ancestral sword to revive garden
- Difficulty: 30 (base) -5 (sacrifice) = 25
- Roll: Performance 4D vs. 25 → 26 (Success, Wild Die 6!)
- Result: +1.5D Flux (0.5D base + 1D bonus), +1D Resonance, Echo created
- Narrative: "The sword dissolves into light. The garden blooms overnight. Workers weep."

## Resonance Dice Pool

- **Max:** 3D
    
- **Gain:** +0.5D per Repletion action
    
- **Use:** Non-combat, story-driven only (persuasion, art, inspire)
    
- **Violence Penalty:** Used for violence? Pool → 0, -1D regional Flux
    

## Balance & Fairness

**Check per session:** `Depletion - Repletion = Net Change`

- **Net -1D or more:** World is dying (standard)
    
- **Net +0D:** Stable (rare)
    
- **Net +1D or more:** World is healing (miracle)
    

If players achieve **+1D net for 3 sessions**:

- **Event:** Hope's Echo—faction offers alliance, new opportunities appear
    
- **GM:** Prepare for campaign tone shift from survival to rebuilding
    

## Repletion vs. Depletion: Faction View

- **Consortium:** Sees Repletion as sabotage (-1D Reputation)
    
- **Covenant:** Sees Repletion as salvation (+1D Reputation)
    
- **Unchained Protocol:** Confused but respectful (+0.5D Reputation)
    
- **Remnant Choir:** Demands more Repletion (will possess if ignored)
    

## GM Warning: The Tontine Paradox

If party focuses only on Repletion, they'll run out of Aetherium to survive.  
If party focuses only on Depletion, they'll kill the world.  
**Balance is key.** The Tontine is a shared pot—everyone must contribute, but no one wants to be the last to pay.
