# The Invention System: Design → Source → Build → Test

## Four-Stage Process

### STAGE 1: DESIGN
**Roll:** Technical/Invent vs. **Difficulty 15 + Complexity**
- **Success:** Blueprints completed
- **Wild Die 6:** Breakthrough! Reduce final difficulty by 5
- **Wild Die 1:** Design flaw discovered later (during test)

**Time:** 1 day per Complexity rating
**Rush Penalty:** -1D per halved time increment

### STAGE 2: SOURCE
**Roll:** Streetwise/Contacts vs. **Difficulty 20**
- **Success:** Acquire all components
- **Wild Die 6:** Find discount or surplus (-20% cost)
- **Wild Die 1:** Components are "tainted" (device has hidden flaw)

**Rare Components Table (create plot hooks):**
| Component | Difficulty | Source | Plot Hook |
|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Mythic Alloy | 25 | Dwarven ruin | Dwarves demand return |
| Virgin Mana | 30 | Covenant grove | Must earn trust |
| Wind-Spirits | 20 | Jade Mandate | Illegal smuggling |
| Blood-Mana | 15 | Collective | Moral compromise |

### STAGE 3: BUILD
**Roll:** Technical/Craft vs. **Same difficulty as Design**
- **Success:** Prototype functional
- **Wild Die 6:** Unexpected bonus feature
- **Wild Die 1:** Rationalization Bleed—device works but permanently reduces workshop Flux by 1 pip

**Time:** 1 day per Complexity rating
**Materials Cost:** Complexity × £100 (standard) / × £300 (mythic)

### STAGE 4: TEST
**Roll:** Operate vs. **Moderate (15)**
- **Wild Die 6:** Device has unexpected synergy with user (bonus +1D when they use it)
- **Wild Die 1:** Spectacular malfunction (damage, social embarrassment, legal trouble)

## Complexity Ratings

| Cx | Time | Difficulty | Cost | Example |
|----|------|------------|------|---------|
| 1 | 1 day | 15 | £100 | Spring-heeled boots |
| 2 | 1 week | 20 | £200 | Vapor-derringer |
| 3 | 1 month | 25 | £300 | Personal glider |
| 4 | 3 months | 30 | £600 | Aetheric carriage |
| 5 | 6 months | 35 | £1,500 | Resonance generator |

## Patent System
If Wild Die 6 on Design roll, invention is **Patentable**:
- **Gain:** +1D Reputation with faction of choice
- **Risk:** Consortium may try to steal it (Difficulty 20 to defend)

## Crowdsourced Inventions
Players can submit inventions to be included in supplements:
- Include blueprint diagram
- Describe all four stages
- Name it after character
- **Reward:** Design credit in next book

## GM Approval
All inventions require GM sign-off. Balance formula:
**(Utility) × (Flux Cost) ÷ (Complexity) = Fairness Rating**
- Rating 1-3: Approved
- Rating 4-6: Requires quest
- Rating 7+: Too powerful, scale down
