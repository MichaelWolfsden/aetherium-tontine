# Campaign Endgame: How the Tontine Ends

## Three Primary Endings

### ENDING 1: The Silence (Consortium Victory)
**Trigger:** Global Flux remains **0D** for **3 consecutive sessions**

**The Event:**
- The Final Theorem is proven: world is fully quantified
- All Aetherium devices become inert simultaneously
- Automatons achieve mass consciousness (Unchained Protocol victory within Consortium framework)
- Magic is **dead**. The gods are **static**. Wonder is **archived**.

**Narrative:**
> "The last rod burns out at midnight. You watch the blue glow fade from Vostok-Prime's engines. The city doesn't fall—it just... stops. The silence is absolute. In the distance, a million clocks strike the same second. The world is a machine that runs perfectly, perpetually, pointlessly. You are redundant. You are alive. That is enough."

**Mechanical Resolution:**
- All PC magic skills become **Technical** skills at half value
- Character Points convert to "Innovation Points" for inventing
- Fate Points become "Legacy Points" (narrate flashbacks)
- **Final Roll:** Spirit vs. 30—Success = you adapt; Failure = you fade

**Player Choice:**
- **Adapt:** Become part of the new world (automaton ally, Gear-Priest)
- **Resist:** Go mad, become Remnant Choir (NPC)
- **Remember:** Retire, become lore-keeper (epilogue)

**GM Epilogue Script:**
"You survive. The world doesn't end—it just changes costumes. Magic was a story. The story is over. Now you write the next one, in brass and binary."

### ENDING 2: Mythic Rebirth (Covenant Victory)
**Trigger:** Global Flux rises to **10D** (miracle)

**The Event:**
- Mass Repletion ritual succeeds (100+ participants)
- Ley lines regenerate, flowing backwards through time
- Aetherium becomes inert—magic works again, raw and wild
- The gods awaken. The Remnant Choir ascends. Wonder is restored.

**Narrative:**
> "The garden you planted in Session 1 has become a forest that covers the city. Vostok-Prime's engines don't fall—they *bloom*. Vines of pure mana wrap the brass. A dragon made of song perches on the Spires and sings the world awake. Your soul fits again. You remember who you were before the Fracture. You are whole."

**Mechanical Resolution:**
- All Technical skills become **Magic** skills at full value
- Aetherium items become **Mythic Artifacts** (ignore charges)
- Character Points become **Wonder Points** (narrate miracles)
- **Final Roll:** Spirit vs. 25—Success = you become myth; Failure = you retire satisfied

**Player Choice:**
- **Ascend:** Become demigod, spirit, fae (retire as NPC legend)
- **Guide:** Become first druids of new age (campaign continues in Reconstruction Era)
- **Release:** Let old world die, embrace wonder (retire in peace)

**GM Epilogue Script:**
"You win. The world is reborn. Magic sings instead of burns. The Tontine is broken. You are the first children of a new age. The meter doesn't matter anymore."

---

### ENDING 3: The Broken Balance (Player Victory)
**Trigger:** Players achieve **equilibrium** (Global Flux 5D stable for 10 sessions)

**The Event:**
- Neither silence nor rebirth—synthesis
- Hybrid technology: Aetherium burns at 1/10th cost, sustained by Repletion
- Remnant Choir and Unchained Protocol form **Covenant of Steel and Song**
- Eight Emporiums sign **Treaty of Balanced Burn** (Jade Mandate model)

**Narrative:**
> "You find the third way. The Resonance Engine isn't stolen—it's shared. Vostok-Prime's engines sing with the Song-Echo. Automatons work alongside druids. The Spine still runs, but its tracks are lined with gardens. The world is still wounded, but healing. The meter still ticks, but slower. You haven't won. You've survived. That's enough."

**Mechanical Resolution:**
- **Flux Level:** Locked at 5D (Flux-Wyld hybrid rules)
- **Skills:** Both Magic and Technical function at -1D (balanced)
- **Character Points:** Split evenly between Innovation and Wonder
- **Final Roll:** Spirit vs. 20—Success = you become Arbiters of Balance; Failure = you retire as teachers

**Player Choice:**
- **Arbitrate:** PCs become new faction leaders (continue campaign in Balance Era)
- **Teach:** Retire, train next generation
- **Wander:** Become nomads, maintaining balance

**GM Epilogue Script:**
"You didn't save the world. You taught it to save itself. The Tontine still exists, but it's a gentleman's agreement now. The pot is still shared, but everyone puts in as much as they take out. You are the architects of a kinder machine."

## Endgame Triggers (How to Get There)

### Path to Silence (Consortium)
- Burn Hyperflux rods recklessly
- Ignore Repletion opportunities
- Kill Covenant leaders
- Let Doom Tracks fill

**GM encourages:** "You need this Aetherium to survive. Just this once."

### Path to Rebirth (Covenant)
- Perform Repletion weekly
- Protect resonance gardens
- Ally with Remnant Choir
- Destroy Aetherium infrastructure (strategically)

**GM encourages:** "The world can heal. You just have to believe."

### Path to Balance (Player-Driven)
- Study Resonance Engine
- Negotiate between factions
- Invent hybrid technology
- Perform both magic and tech (no extremes)

**GM encourages:** "There has to be a middle way."

## Early Warning Signs (5 sessions before endgame)

### Silence Warning
- **Session -5:** Aetherium prices triple
- **Session -4:** Automatons begin ignoring orders
- **Session -3:** Gods' voices become static
- **Session -2:** Magic items become inert
- **Session -1:** Global Flux drops to 1D

### Rebirth Warning
- **Session -5:** Gardens grow overnight
- **Session -4:** Wild Die explodes on 4-6
- **Session -3:** Spirits manifest physically
- **Session -2:** Remnant Choir offers alliance
- **Session -1:** Global Flux rises to 9D

### Balance Warning
- **Session -5:** Resonance Engine schematic leaks
- **Session -4:** Factions begin negotiating
- **Session -3:** Hybrid magic-tech items appear
- **Session -2:** Treaty proposals circulate
- **Session -1:** Global Flux stabilizes at 5D

## Player Choice in Endgame
**Final Session:** Players vote on ending path
- **Majority rules:** 2/3 vote determines outcome
- **Tiebreaker:** GM decides based on cumulative actions
- **Solo dissent:** Dissenting player can trigger alternative ending (personal sacrifice)

## Alternative Personal Endings
If party is split, each PC can have **personal ending:**

- **The Martyr:** Sacrifice self to power Repletion (guarantees Rebirth)
- **The Luddite:** Destroy all Aetherium on person (guarantees Silence for region)
- **The Architect:** Stay neutral, become teacher (guarantees Balance)

**GM:** "What do you write in the world's obituary? Or is it a birth announcement?"

## Epilogue Generation
After final roll, ask each player:
1. **What does your character do after the Tontine?**
2. **What monument is built to them?**
3. **What song is sung about them?**
