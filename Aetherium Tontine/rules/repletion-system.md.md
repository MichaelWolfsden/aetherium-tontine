# Repletion: The Second Law of Thermomythics

## Principle
*The world can remember wonder. Memory demands sacrifice.*

## Qualifying Actions
Must meet **2+ criteria**:
- **No mechanical benefit** to character
- **Advances another PC's** narrative arc
- **Creates beauty/wonder** in a blight zone
- **Risks character safety** for world-building
- **Refuses optimal choice** for moral reason

## Examples
- Plant garden in blight zone
- Teach myth to child (no benefit)
- Sacrifice magic item to revive forest
- Create art that moves NPCs to tears
- Take **Narrative Disadvantage** (e.g., "Haunted by Beauty")
- Refuse Aetherium payment

## Repletion Roll
- **Difficulty:** 30 (Heroic)
- **Cannot spend Character Points** (must be pure narrative)
- **Attribute+Skill:** Spirit, Art, Performance, or Knowledge (Mythic)
- **Wild Die:** 6 reduces difficulty by 5 (Eureka!), 1 causes -2D Flux (reality rejects)

## Repletion Table

| Action | Difficulty | Flux Δ | Resonance Dice | Echo Risk | Example |
|--------|------------|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Minor beauty | 25 | +0.5D | +0.5D | Low | Paint mural in slum |
| Teach myth | 15 | +0.1D | +0.5D | None | Story to child |
| Sacrifice item | 30 | +1D | +1D | Medium | Magic sword → forest |
| Public art | 20 | +0.3D | +0.5D | Low | Statue in square |
| Refuse payment | 10 (moral) | +0.2D | +0.5D | None | Turn down bribe |
| Willing death | 50 | +3D | +2D | High | Suicide ritual |

## Resonance Dice Pool
- **Max:** 3D
- **Use:** Non-combat, story-driven actions only (persuasion, art, inspire)
- **Cannot use for:** Combat, sabotage, self-preservation
- **Violence Penalty:** If used for violence, pool resets to 0, -1D regional Flux

## Mythic Echoes
If Wild Die 6 on Repletion roll, creates **semi-permanent** story element:
- **Garden:** Grows 1 sq mile/session if tended
- **Song:** Haunts area, +1D morale to allies
- **Spirit:** Friendly ghost offers cryptic advice
- **Artifact:** Mundane object becomes minor magic item

Echoes attract **Remnant Choir** attention (50% chance per session).

## Reputation Gain
- **Covenant:** +1D Reputation per successful Repletion
- **Unchained Protocol:** +0.5D (respect but confusion)
- **Consortium:** -1D Reputation (seen as sabotage)

## Narrative Disadvantages
Take these voluntarily for Repletion credit:
- **"Haunted by Beauty"** (+3D): -1D to combat rolls (hesitate to destroy)
- **"Mythic Debt"** (+3D): Owe favors to Remnant Choir
- **"Repletion Addict"** (+2D): Must perform Repletion monthly or depression

## GM Warning
If party achieves **10D Flux** in region, creates **Mythic Rebirth** event—world begins healing. Campaign shifts tone from survival to rebuilding. Prepare for campaign evolution.
