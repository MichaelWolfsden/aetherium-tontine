# Session 2: The Inquisitor's Mercy

## Narrative Summary
Voss confronts party at Engine #7, offers choice: fix engine and erase Social Debt, or be executed as saboteurs. Gear-Heart negotiates. Jaguar-Knight discovers Phlogiston spill in storage (alchemical unleashing). Skald-Berserker's saga inspires workers to strike. Party chooses Repletion over repair.

## Key Events
1. **Negotiation:** Gear-Heart succeeds at Difficult (20) Social roll—Voss grants 24 hours
2. **Phlogiston Spill:** Jaguar-Knight discovers leak, 3 workers mutating
3. **Worker Strike:** Skald's saga triggers strike, -2D Consortium control district-wide
4. **Repletion Ritual:** Party sacrifices Aetherium rods to revive small garden in Soot-Lanes
