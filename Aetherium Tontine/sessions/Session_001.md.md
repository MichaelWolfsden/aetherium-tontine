# Session 1: The Engine Song

## Narrative Summary
The party arrives in Vostok-Prime's Engine District, hearing rumors of a "song in the pipes." Gear-Heart investigates Engine #7, discovers Repletion potential. Jaguar-Knight scouts Inquisitor patrols. Skald-Berserker performs saga for workers. Engine sabotage/Repletion succeeds, raising local Flux to 3D. Inquisitor Voss confused by Echo.

## Key Events
